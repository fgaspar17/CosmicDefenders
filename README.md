# Cosmic Defenders

Cosmic Defenders is a classic arcade-style shooter inspired by Space Invaders.
You control a spaceship and must defeat incoming alien waves before they reach the asteroids or destroy your ship.

The game is developed in C# using SFML.Net, focusing on low-level game concepts such as rendering, game loops, collisions, and basic AI.

## Gameplay Overview

- Move the spaceship using the Left and Right arrow keys
- Shoot using the Space bar
- Destroy enemies to earn score points
- Survive 5 progressively harder levels
- Prevent enemies from reaching the asteroids or you lose the game

## Features

- Main menu to select an option between Play, Scores and Exit.
